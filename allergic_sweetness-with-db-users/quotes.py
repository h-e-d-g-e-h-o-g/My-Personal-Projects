    "quote": "All I know about being good, I learned from TV. And in TV, flawed characters are constantly showing people they care with these surprising and grand gestures. And I think a part of me still believes that's what love is. But in real life, the big gesture isn’t enough. You need to be consistent, you need to be dependably good. You can’t just screw everything up and then take a boat out into the ocean to save your best friend, or solve a mystery and fly to Kansas. You need to do it every day, which is so… hard.",
