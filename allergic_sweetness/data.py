            "Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by high levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. This occurs either because the body does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or because the body's cells do not respond properly to the insulin produced. As a result, the glucose cannot enter the cells and remains in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels.",
